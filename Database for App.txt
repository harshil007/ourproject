/* 
 
   
   
   **student_rated table** is for storing the individual ratings for each faculty by each student 
   
   As a student rates any faculty, the id of faculty will be checked in his f_rated record and 
    if it is not present, then facultyid, r1,r2,r3 will be stored in f_rated.
   Next facultyid and r1, r2, r3 will be appended to the f_rated column of that particular student_id.
   
   *faculty_rating table** is for storing total ratings of each category for every faculty that has been rated

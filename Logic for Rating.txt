If for the first time:
		
		total_star[fac_ID] += given_star;
		total_rated[fac_ID] ++ ;
		
		fac_rating[fac_ID] = (float) total_star[fac_ID] / total_rated[fac_ID] ;

Not for the first time:
		
		total_star[fac_ID] -= <<DEPENDS ON TABLE, WILL TALK TOMORROW>>

		fac_rating[fac_ID] = (float) total_star[fac_ID] / total_rated[fac_ID] ;
